# Course Jumper
Module to facilitate skipping Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/) videos.

## Why?
Skipera assists in automatically skip irrelevant MOOC courses which are made mandatory by universities. 
Many of such courses are allotted directly by the university as credit fillers and are not in the interest of the student. The progress of the completion of these courses is tracked by the university and credits are allotted.

## How?
Course Jumper makes use of the Serv0id's Skipera and completes the videos + reading materials.
Surveys are not automatically completed since they are graded, thus needing user interaction to complete.
